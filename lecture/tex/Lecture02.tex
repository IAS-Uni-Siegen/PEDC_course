            \item Two models of atom exist: classical and quantum.
            \item The classical model of the atom is based on the idea that atoms are made up of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) surrounded by electrons that orbit the nucleus in fixed paths- Rutherford's Atomic Model
            \item The quantum model of the atom is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic quantised energy levels- Bohr's Atomic Model:
            \item Both model states: atoms consist of a nucleus (protons \& neutrons) \& electrons that orbit the nucleus.

          \begin{itemize}
            \item The energy required to remove an electron from an atom is called ionisation energy.
            \item The ionisation energy varies for different elements and is generally higher for elements with more protons in the nucleus.
            \item The ionisation energy is also affected by the distance of the electron from the nucleus and the number of electrons in the valence shell- outermost shell is more vulnerable to ionisation!
            \item Atoms with low ionisation energy tend to lose electrons easily and form positive ions, while atoms with high ionisation energy tend to gain electrons and form negative ions.
            \item The ionisation energy is an important factor in determining the chemical reactivity of an element.

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The electrical properties of materials can be classified into three categories based on their ability to conduct electricity:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Insulators} have valence electrons tightly bound to the atoms and do not have free electrons to conduct electricity. Insulators have a \textbf{very high ionisation energy}, meaning they require a lot of energy to remove an electron from the atom. So they are bad conductors of electricity. Examples: rubber, glass, and plastic.
                \item \textbf{Conductors} have a large number of loosly bounded electrons that can move easily through the material, allowing them to conduct electricity well. Conductors have a \textbf{low ionisation energy}, meaning they require very little energy to remove an electron from the atom. So, they have a low resistance to the flow of electric current. Examples: metals like copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al).
                \item \textbf{Semiconductors*} in pure or intrinsic state is neither a good conductor nor a good insulator. They have to be synthesized as compounds or made extrinsic by adding impurities (doping) to change their electrical properties. Examples: Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) as intrinsic and gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium nitride, silicon carbide are extrinsic.
            \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            *Semiconductors can conduct electricity under certain conditions, such as when they are doped with impurities or when they are exposed to light or heat.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The energy levels are \textbf{quantized}, meaning that electrons can only occupy certain energy levels and cannot exist in between them.
        \item Total energy of the electron is negative, which means that the electron is bound to the nucleus and cannot escape without an external energy input.
        \item Energy $\propto \frac{-1}{r}$, the closer the electron is to the nucleus (smaller $r$), the more negative (tightly bound) its energy becomes.
        \item As $r \rightarrow \infty$, $W \rightarrow 0$, meaning the electron is free from the nucleus and has zero energy.
        \item The negative sign indicates that the electron is in a bound state, and energy must be supplied to remove it from the atom.
        \item Atomic stability: at equilibrium, electrons sit at a stable radius with a specific energy â€” this defines discrete energy levels in atoms.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The energy levels of electrons in an atom are quantized, meaning that they can only occupy certain discrete energy levels.
        \item Typically what we learnt (planetary model) is true for classical mechanics.
        \item As per classical laws of electromagnetism, electrons are charged particles and should radiate energy as they move in circular orbits around the nucleus, causing them to spiral inward and eventually collide with the nucleus.
        \item However, this does not happen in reality, and electrons do not lose energy in this way.
        \item This is because electrons are also subject to the principles of \textbf{quantum mechanics*}, which govern their behaviour at the atomic and subatomic levels.

        \item \textbf{Quantized Energy Levels:} Electrons can only occupy certain discrete energy states. When in these stationary states, electrons do not emit radiation.

        \item \textbf{Radiation via Transition:} Electrons emit or absorb energy only when transitioning between stationary states:
        \begin{equation}
        f = \frac{W_2 - W_1}{h}
        \end{equation}
        where $f$ is frequency and $h$ is Planck's constant.

        mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi}

%        \item In solids, while $n$ doesn't appear directly, quantization still occurs due to boundary conditions in periodic potentials (crystal structure).
%        \item As $n$ increases, energy levels become closer together, leading to band formation.
        \item \textbf{Energy bands}: In Bohr's model, $n$ defined specific orbits and energies but in solids, energy levels are not discrete but form bands due to the overlap of atomic orbitals. The energy bands are separated by band gaps, which determine the electrical properties of the material.

                \item In semiconductors, the energy band gap is small enough that some electrons can be thermally excited from the valence band to the conduction band at room temperature.
                \item This process creates \textbf{free electrons} (also called \textbf{conduction electrons}) in the conduction band and \textbf{holes} (a vacant state that behaves like a positive charge) in the valence band.
                \item  Example: At room temperature, intrinsic silicon has enough thermal energy to excite some valence electrons across the band gap.
                \item This process results in \textbf{electron-hole pairs}.
                \item Free electrons and holes drift under electric fields and contribute to electrical conductivity.
                \item The concentration of free electrons and holes in a semiconductor can be controlled by doping with impurities.

\begin{frame}{Lorentz Force and Hall Field}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider a semiconductor sample placed in a magnetic field $\vec{B}$ in the $z$-direction.
        \item A current $I$ is passed in the $x$-direction, perpendicular to $\vec{B}$.
        \item Charge carriers (electrons or holes) moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ experience a force:
        \begin{equation}
        \vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
        \end{equation}
        \item This Lorentz force deflects carriers in the $+y$ direction, creating:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Negative charge on the $+y$ side (if electrons dominate)
            \item Positive charge on the $-y$ side
        \end{itemize}
        \item This generates an electric field $E_H$ opposing the Lorentz force:
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz_force}
        \vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0 
        \end{equation}

% Hall Field and Charge Type Identification
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Hall Voltage and Carrier Type}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Solving Eq. \ref{eq:Lorentz_force} gives the Hall field:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{E} = v_x B_z 
        \end{equation}
        \item This field gives rise to a Hall voltage:
        \begin{equation}
        V_H = d \mathcal{E} = d v_x B_z
        \end{equation}
        \item $d$: width of the semiconductor sample
        \item Since current $I \propto q v_x$, the sign of $V_H$ indicates:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $V_H > 0$: Majority carriers are electrons (n-type)
            \item $V_H < 0$: Majority carriers are holes (p-type)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Thus, \textbf{Hall effect enables determination of carrier type} in semiconductors
    \end{itemize}

% Derivation of Hall Voltage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Experimental Determination of $\mu$ and $\rho$}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the equilibrium state the electric field intensity $\mathcal{E}$ due to Hall effect must be equal to the magnetic force:
        \begin{equation}
        q\mathcal{E} = Bqv \tag{2-21}
        \end{equation}
        \item Using $\mathcal{E} = \frac{V_H}{d}$ and $J = \rho v = \frac{I}{wd}$, where $\rho$ is the charge density, $w$ is the width of the sample, and $J$ is the current density:
        \begin{equation}
        V_H = \mathcal{E}d = Bvd = \frac{BJd}{\rho} = \frac{BI}{\rho w} \tag{2-22}
        \end{equation}
        \item Hence $\rho$ can be expressed as:
        \begin{equation}
        \rho = \frac{BI}{V_H w} \Rightarrow R_H = \frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{V_H w}{BI} \tag{2-23, 2-24}
        \end{equation}
        where $R_H$ is the Hall coefficient.

\begin{frame}{How mobility and diffusion are related of charge carrier are related?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mobility} ($\mu$): Measure of how quickly charge carriers (electrons or holes) can move through a semiconductor material in response to an electric field.
        \item \textbf{Diffusion coefficient} ($D$): Measure of how quickly charge carriers can spread out in a semiconductor material due to concentration gradients.
        \item \textbf{Einstein relation}: Connects mobility and diffusion coefficient:
        \begin{equation}
        D = \frac{kT}{q} \mu    
        \end{equation}
        \item Where:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $k$: Boltzmann constant
            \item $T$: Absolute temperature (in Kelvin)
            \item $q$: Elementary charge (charge of an electron)
        \end{itemize}
        \item This relation shows that the diffusion coefficient is directly proportional to the mobility of charge carriers and the temperature.
        \item Higher mobility leads to higher diffusion rates, which is important for understanding charge transport in semiconductors.

\begin{frame}{Relevance of Einstein relation?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Einstein relation is a fundamental concept that bridge the microscopic thermal motion of carriers with their macroscopic electrical behavior, and is essential for modeling how semiconductors behave under various conditions.
        \item \textbf{Unifies Drift and Diffusion:} Shows that mobility (drift due to electric field) and diffusion (due to concentration gradient) are inherently linked by thermal motion.
        \item \textbf{Device Modeling:} Essential for modeling carrier transport in semiconductors such as diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETs where both drift and diffusion processes coexist.
        \item \textbf{Simplifies Analysis:} If one parameter (e.g., mobility) is known, diffusion coefficient can be calculated, reducing experimental complexity.
        \item \textbf{Temperature Dependence:} Since $D \propto T$ and $\mu \propto T^{-m}$ (where $m \approx 1.5$), the Einstein relation captures how transport properties change with temperature â€” crucial for thermal sensor and reliability design.
        \item \textbf{Measurement and Material Characterization:} Enables calculation of diffusion coefficient $D$ from mobility $\mu$ measured using Hall effect.

% Deriving the Einstein Relation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Deriving Einstein Relation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Einstein relation connects the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and the mobility ($\mu$) of charge carriers in thermal equilibrium.
        \item For electrons:
        \begin{equation}
        D_n = \frac{kT}{q} \mu_n, \quad \text{and for holes: } D_p = \frac{kT}{q} \mu_p
        \end{equation}
        \item \textbf{Start with the drift current:} 
        \begin{equation}
        J_n^{\text{drift}} = q n \mu_n \mathcal{E}
        \end{equation}
        \item \textbf{In equilibrium}, the total electron current must be zero:
        \begin{equation}
        J_n^{\text{drift}} + J_n^{\text{diff}} = 0
        \Rightarrow q n \mu_n \mathcal{E} + q D_n \frac{dn}{dx} = 0
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Deriving Einstein Relation. Contd.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item From Boltzmann distribution:
        \begin{equation}
        n(x) \propto e^{-q\phi(x)/kT} \Rightarrow \frac{dn}{dx} = \frac{q n \mathcal{E}}{kT}
        \end{equation}
        \item Substituting back into current balance:
        \begin{align*}
        q n \mu_n \mathcal{E} + q D_n \left( \frac{q n \mathcal{E}}{kT} \right) &= 0 \\
        \Rightarrow q n \mathcal{E} \left( \mu_n + \frac{q D_n}{kT} \right) &= 0
        \end{align*}
        \item Since $q n \mathcal{E} \neq 0$ in general, we get:
        \begin{equation}
        D_n = \frac{kT}{q} \mu_n
        \end{equation}
        \item Similarly, for holes:
        \begin{equation}
        D_p = \frac{kT}{q} \mu_p
