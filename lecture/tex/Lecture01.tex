	\begin{varblock}{Power Electronics more relevant than ever}
		Knowledge of power electronics devices is crucial for designing efficient systems that convert, control, and deliver electrical energy. It enables innovation in EVs, renewable energy, robotics, and industrial automation by optimizing performance, minimizing losses, and ensuring reliable operation. 
	\end{varblock}
	\begin{varblock}{Power electronics is the key to efficiency and sustainability}<2->
		Power electronic systems handle and convert more than 70\% of global electricity across industries such as transportation, energy, and automation (source: \href{https://www.hitachienergy.com/news-and-events/perspectives/2021/08/power-electronics-revolutionizing-the-world-s-future-energy-systems}{International Energy Agency}). With rising demands for electrification, advancing device efficiency and reliability is critical to minimizing energy losses, improving system performance, and enabling sustainable technologies across the globe.
