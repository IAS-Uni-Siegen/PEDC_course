\task{Properties of germanium as semiconductor}

The following problems explore fundamental semiconductor properties of germanium. 
Starting with atomic concentration and intrinsic resistivity, the tasks gradually introduce doping effects 
and compare the electrical behavior of intrinsic and extrinsic materials under simplified assumptions.

\begin{table}[ht]

        \toprule
         Atomic weight: &  $\SI{72.6}{\gram\per\mole}$ & Density: & $\SI{5.32}{\gram\per{\cubic\centi\meter}}$ \\

\subtask{Using Avogadroâ€™s number ($N_{Av}=\SI{6.02}{1\per\mol}$), calculate the concentration of atoms in germanium based on the numerical value given in \autoref{table:ex01_germanium_values}.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    A quantity of any substance equal to its molecular weight in grams is a mole.
    So the concentration is calculated by
    \begin{equation}
        C_{Ger} = \frac{N_{Av}}{A_\mathrm{T}} \cdot D 
        =\frac{\SI{6.02}{1\per\mol}}{\SI{72.6}{\gram\per\mole}} \cdot \SI{5.32}{\gram\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}
    \end{equation}
\end{solutionblock}

\subtask{Find the resistivity of intrinsic germanium at $\SI{300}{\kelvin}$ .}

\begin{solutionblock}
    Using the equation $n=p=n_i$ the conductivity of the intrinsic germanium is calculated by
    \begin{equation}
        \sigma  = n_i^2q(\mu_n+\mu_p) = \SI{2.5 \cdot 10^{13}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}} \cdot \SI{1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}}{\coulomb}
        \cdot \left( \SI{3800}{\square{\centi\meter}\per{\volt\second}} + \SI{3800}{\square{\centi\meter}\per{\volt\second}} \right)
        = \SI{0.00224}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}
    \end{equation}
    The resistivity results by the reciprocal value:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{1}{\SI{0.00224}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}}= \SI{44.6}{\ohm\centi\meter}
    \end{equation}    
\end{solutionblock}


\subtask{If a donor-type impurity is added to the extent of 1 part in $10^8$ germanium atoms, find the resistivity.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    If there is 1 donor atom per $10^8$ germanium atoms, then $N_D= \SI{4.41 \cdot 10^{14}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}$.
    Using the fact $n \approx N_D$ leads to:
    \begin{equation}
        p  = \frac{n_i^2}{N_D} = \frac{\left({\SI{2.5 \cdot 10^{13}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}}\right)^2}{\SI{4.41 \cdot 10^{14}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}}
        = \SI{1.42 \cdot 10^{12}}{holes\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}
    \end{equation}
    Since $n \ll p$, we can neglect $p$ in calculating the conductivity. This leads to:
    \begin{equation}
        \sigma = nq\mu_n = \SI{4.41 \cdot 10^{14}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}} \cdot \SI{1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}}{\coulomb}
        \cdot \SI{3800}{\square{\centi\meter}\per{\volt\second}} = \SI{0.268}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}
    \end{equation}
    The resistivity results by the reciprocal value:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{1}{\SI{0.268}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}}= \SI{3.72}{\ohm\centi\meter}
    \end{equation} 
\end{solutionblock}


\subtask{If germanium were a monovalent metal, find the ratio of its conductivity to that of the n-type semiconductor in previous subtask.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    If each atom contributed one free electron to the material the number of free electrons are $n  = 4.41 \cdot 10^{22}$.
    This leads to:
    \begin{equation}
        \sigma = nq\mu_n = \SI{4.41 \cdot 10^{22}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}} \cdot \SI{1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}}{\coulomb}
        \cdot \SI{3800}{\square{\centi\meter}\per{\volt\second}} = \SI{2.58 \cdot 10^{7}}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}
    \end{equation}
    The ratio yields:
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\sigma_{metal}}{\sigma_{semi}}= \frac{ \SI{2.58 \cdot 10^{7}}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}}{\SI{0.268}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}}
        \approx 10^8
    \end{equation}

\end{solutionblock}

\subtask{Calculate the frequency of revolution for an electron in the ground state of hydrogen. For comparison, find the
frequency emitted when an electron falls from the state to the ground state.}

\subtask{Find the room-temperature resistivity of an n-type silicon doped with $10^16$ phosphorus $\si{atoms\per \cubic{\centi\meter}}$.}

\begin{solutionblock}
    At room temperature we assume that all donors are ionized. 
    This leads to:
    \begin{equation}
        n \approx N_D = \SI{10^{16}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}}
    \end{equation}
    The conductivity is calculated by
    \begin{equation}
        \sigma = nq\mu_n = \SI{10^{16}}{atoms\per{\cubic{\centi\meter}}} \cdot \SI{1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}}{\coulomb}
        \cdot \SI{1300}{\square{\centi\meter}\per{\volt\second}} = \SI{20.8}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}
    \end{equation}
    The resistivity results by the reciprocal value:
    \begin{equation}
        \rho = \frac{1}{\sigma} = \frac{1}{\SI{20.8}{1\per{\ohm\centi\meter}}}= \SI{0.48}{\ohm\centi\meter}

\begin{solutionblock}
    The Hall coefficient is calculated by
    \begin{equation}
        R_H = \frac{1}{qn} = \frac{1}{\SI{1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}}{\coulomb} \cdot 10^{16}} =  \SI{625}{\cubic{\centi\meter}\per\coulomb}
    \end{equation}
    The Hall voltage results from
    \begin{equation}
        V_h = R_H \frac{I}{A}B_z W = \SI{625}{\cubic{\centi\meter}\per\coulomb} \frac{\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}}{\SI{2.5 \cdot 10^{-3}}{\square\centi\meter}}
        \SI{10^{-4}}{\weber\per\square\centi\meter} \cdot \SI{500}{\micro\meter} = \SI{-1.25}{\milli\volt}
